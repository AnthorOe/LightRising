So, you want to set up your own version of Shintolin?

Shintolin runs as a bunch of CGI scripts, so it should work on any server with Apache, Ruby (1.8) and MySQL installed.

You'll find a database template in dbtemplate.sql. You'll need to create a MySQL database called 'shintolin'; the command to import the data should be something like 'mysql -p shintolin < dbtemplate.sql'. If you want to check the import worked, open the MySQL prompt and type 'show tables;' - you should see 12 table names.

Getting Ruby to talk to MySQL is annoying. Really annoying. Follow the instructions on http://tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby/ and see how you get on. It took me almost a whole day to get it to work (!) but that's because I'm a noob and used a package called XAMPP instead of installing Apache and MySQL seperately. The file 'mysql-connect.rb' handles the database connection for Shintolin, so make sure you change the settings there; in particular, 'root' should be changed for your username and '' with your password.

Shintolin isn't the best example of Ruby code; in particular, it's not very object-oriented, because I didn't properly understand object-orientation when I began working on version II of the game. There's probably a few other things I'd do differently now - still, you should see the orginal PHP version.

If your changes are good, I'm not averse to adding them to the master version of Shintolin. E-mail me at: allthatyousee AT gmail DOT com and I'll see what I ca n do.

Happy hacking!
