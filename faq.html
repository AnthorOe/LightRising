<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<h3>What is Light Rising?</h3>
<p>Light Rising is a Web Browser Based, Massive Multiplayer Role Playing Game, based in Space.</p>
<p>The game is playable from any device that has a web browser, without the need for specialized plugins.</p>

<h3>Is there a Tutorial?</h3>
<p>As Light Rising is in its early stages of beta testing, there is currently no tutorial guide, but you can find help on the 
 <a href='http://forum.lightrising.com'>Forum</a>, and on the <a href='http://wiki.lightrising.com'>Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3>What is AP?</h3>
<p>AP are action points, and represent your character's limited time and energy. Most actions in Light Rising cost AP; when your AP drops below 0, you must rest before you can do anything else.</p>
<p>Action points are automatically restored every hour. If you rest inside certain areas, a building or by a campfire, you'll recover AP more quickly.</p>

<h3>What are IP Hits, and how do they affect me?</h3>
<p>IP Hits are related to the number of times your web browser refreshes the game pages. To control bandwidth usage and prevent one person from creating and playing
a large number of characters, you may eventually come up against the IP Hit Limit. For Beta Testing, this is currently set to 500 Hits per day. When you come close
to hitting this limit, you will receive a warning message. When you hit the limit, you will no longer be able to play until the next day. At some future point the IP Hits
Limit may be reduced to allow for only one to three free characters per day, with more allowed via purchase or donation.
<p>

<h3>How does hunger work?</h3>
<p>You lose 1 hunger point every 8 hours - eating one food item restores 1 hunger point. If your hunger hits 0, you will slowly lose HP (Health Points). Your character will automatically eat if they have food in their posession, 
so keep stocked up and you'll be OK. As some people do not enjoy the hunger mechanism, it is one aspect of the game engine that we will be looking to change
 in the future, but for now it is necessary. The amount of food you can consume has been raised to 20 items, so if your character eats a lot in one go, you won't
 need more food for approx. 6-7 real life days.</p>

<h3>What's the point of the game?</h3>
<p>If you've just signed up, you should probably try to find a source of food, though your supply of noobcakes will keep you fed 
for the first few days if you want to explore. Food can be found by searching, by killing animals or Alien creatures, or by farming or baking.
Gaining XP (Experience Points) so you can buy skills and level up is a good idea. 
Currently much of the action in Light Rising takes place in settlements within the Ascension Space Station, so joining one might give you both assistance and things to do.</p>
<p>Light Rising is open-ended, and players can decide their own goals. Once you've found your feet, you could try to earn a living by hunting, 
farming, crafting or trading, get involved with settlement life and politics, gather some followers to found your own village, 
embark on a war of conquest, or try something else entirely. It's up to you.</p>

<p>Please Note:- Light Rising's game engine is based on an open source game engine called Shintolin. We have already made extensive changes to the theme
 and content, along with minor changes to the game engine mechanics. Over time there will be a great number of modifications to allow for additional mechanics,
  such as, space travel/warfare/trading, playable alien races, dimensional and temporal travel, degenerating infrastructure, and many other new features.

<h3>I searched and didn't find anything...</h3>
<p>Searching isn't succesful every time, so you might need to try searching a few times before you find anything. If you're still not finding much, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search rates are variable. If a lot of people have searched a square recently, it'll be harder to find things. Try seeing if you have better luck searching away from densely populated areas - or buy the Foraging skill, which lets you see the resource level of a square.</li>
<li>Search rates vary by season. You won't find very much food in winter - it's worth stocking up during Spring and Summer.</li>
<li>Some squares don't have anything to find. This includes dirt, fields, and dead space tiles.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I'm dazed! What can I do?</h3>
<p>When your HP drops to 0, whether by injury, starvation or something else, you become spirit form.. Your actions are limited and you recover AP more slowly; another player must revive you with a herbal poultice or herbal tea (for 25AP), or you can revive yourself with a herbal poultice or herbal tea (for 50AP) and you end up back at the Statue of the Ascension..</p>
<p>Your best bet for revival is to find a settlement with a hospital; failing that, finding a large group of people will give you a better chance of being healed than staying in the countryside. Try offering items for someone to revive you, and be sure to actually ask other players for revival.</p>

<p>Please Note:- You CAN now revive yourself with a herbal poultice or herbal tea!</p>

<h3>Why did everyone in settlement X attack me?</h3>
<p>That depends on them; maybe they didn't like you taking items from their stockpile, maybe they didn't like you chopping down their trees, maybe they just don't like strangers. Try another village, you might find a better welcome.</p>

<h3>Am I allowed to register multiple accounts?</h3>
<p>To explore the different options in the world of Light Rising during the live beta test, you are currently allowed to register up to 3 accounts, however there are certain rules. You must keep your characters seperate (at least 10 tiles apart). They must live seperate lives, and not assist each other in any way. Registering multiple characters to acheive your goals is known as <i>zerging</i> or <i>alt abuse</i>, and is against the spirit of the game. Light Rising is about collaborating with other people, not a 'who-can-register-the-most-throwaway-accounts' contest.</p>
<p>Actions considered alt abuse include having characters that reside in the same settlement, characters trading items with each other, characters ganging up to attack another character or animal, and one character leaving items in a stockpile for another to pick up. This isn't an exhaustive list.</p>
<p>There is currently a 500-hit IP limit to prevent you from using more than 3 accounts. Cheating and/or using more accounts than you are allowed will get you banned without warning.</p>

<h3>But I forgot my password/want to use a different character. I don't want to get banned for signing up for a new account. Can I delete my old one(s)?</h3>
<p>No. However, if you don't sign in with that character for 5 days they will idle out. Simply let your character idle out and then sign up for a new account. As long as you are only using three characters at one time, I do not care which three they are. (Donated for characters, obviously, do not count against this number.)</p>

<h3>Zerging, Griefing, and Offensive Behavior</h3>
<p>All Zerging (except in the early beta testing), Griefing, and any other Offensive Behavior (including attempts to hack or modify the server) will not be tolerated. Consequences range from: warnings, temporary and permanent bans, to legal action. The primary purpose of the game is for everyone to have fun. Don't spoil it for others.
</p>

<h3>Age Restrictions</h3>
<p>Light Rising is currently rated as PG-13. The plan is to make R-Rated areas and content later, and have age restrictions, but please bear in mind that the game is rated for both young and old and keep your language and roleplayed actions to an appropriate level.</p>
<p>If/When there are R-Rated sections of the game created, the main part of the game will always be PG-13. There will also be an announcement and an age check that you will be required to manually select in your account prior to being able to play the R-Rated content.</p>
<p>And of course, no kind of harrassment or griefing will be tolerated.</p>



<h2>Development</h2>

<h3>Light Rising is currently in a live beta testing stage.</h3>
<p>Therefore, there are no guarantees on features or functionality, the game may be reset or unavailable at anytime
 as new features come online. As this is an ongoing and long process, the beta may continue for a while. The source code for Light Rising will be available after the beta test period ends.</p>

<h3>What games is Light Rising based on?</h3>
<p>Light Rising primarily owes many of its game mechanics to <a href='http://www.shintolin.co.uk/'>Shintolin</a>, but the idea for the game came from playing <a href='http://www.shartak.com'>Shartak</a>, and 
<a href='http://www.urbandead.com'>Urban Dead</a>, all three of which feature grid-based gameplay and an AP system. And from playing many MANY other games over the years, including the David Braben's original 3D Space Game: Elite, FTL's Sundog and Lord British's Ultima Series.  </p>

<h3>I have some cool ideas for the game!</h3>
<p>Post them on the suggestions section of the forums - we will try to look at all well-thought-out ideas. Also, be sure to comment on other people's suggestions; it's a big help when designing to have different points of view to read.</p>
